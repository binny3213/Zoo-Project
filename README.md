# Zoo-Project
System Purpose: Developed a Zoo management system for user interaction with a fictional zoo.
Database Management: Maintained a database containing information related to the zoo.
Applied OOP concepts: Utilized encapsulation to protect the integrity of the data and ensure that objects only expose
necessary functionalities. Applied polymorphism to allow animal objects to be treated as instances of their parent class,
enabling flexibility and integration. Implemented inheritance to promote code reuse and establish a hierarchical
relationship between classes.
